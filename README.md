# SecretFolder

## Description

This Python program allows you to create a concealed secret folder in any directory of your choice, where you can securely store your sensitive files and documents. The unique twist lies in its Recycle Bin disguise â€“ when the correct password is entered, the folder transforms into a Recycle Bin, concealing its true nature and safeguarding your data from prying eyes.

## Features

- Create a hidden secret folder to protect your confidential files.
- Toggle folder visibility by entering the correct password.
- Transform the folder into a Recycle Bin for added camouflage.
- Simple and intuitive user experience.
- Customizable location and password settings.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files as a zip.
2. In "LOCATION.txt" specify the directory path where you want the secret folder to be created (e.g., C:\SecretFolder).
3. In "PASSWORD.txt" set the desired password to secure your secret folder (e.g., Password123).
4. Run the Python script (`SecretFolder.py`).
5. Enter the password to convert the folder to a Recycle Bin and hide its contents.
6. Re-enter the password to reveal the secret folder and access your files.
